# Jekyll New Post Helper

This is a simple script to allow you to quickly create a new blog post when using Jekyll with some boiler plate inside it.

## Usage

Copy the new-post.sh to the _posts directory of your Jekyll blog.  If the script is not executable make it so with `chmod +x new-post.sh`.  Run the script and enter a title for your post.

The script will convert your title to lower case and replace spaces with `-` for the filename.
